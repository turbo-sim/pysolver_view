The selling points are:

- Convenient object oriented problem definition
- Detailed report of solution feasibility and constraint satisfaction
- KKT Check
- Calculation of lagranbge multipliers
- Callback function between iterations, user defined, for instance to plot in real time, or save files at each iteration
- Print and plot convergence progress in real time (obje, function, contraints, convergence indicators)
- Functionality to adjust problem scaling
- Access to the optimization algorithms in Scipy and Pygmo
